# Spicetify Side Hide Extension

Spicetify Side Hide is a simple Spicetify extension that hides the Spotify sidebar and associated buttons. 

## How it works
- On window initialization, find Friends Activity button, Now Playing button, and the sidebar and hide them via CSS.
- Queue and Device Connect functionality remains

## Note: Consider Sidebar Customizer
For more flexibility and control, check out the **[Sidebar Customizer](../sidebar-customizer/README.md)** extension. It offers:
- Individual toggle controls for all 4 sidebar elements (Friend Activity, Queue, Connect to Device, Now Playing View)
- Preference persistence via localStorage
- Easy-to-use toggles in the profile menu
- Cleaner appearance with proper styling
